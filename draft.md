## The Rare Earth
Basically we're unique.

The rare Earth hypetheiss argues that planets with complex life, like Earth are extremely rare and that extraterrestrial life is highly improbable. Hence, we are one of a kind.

## The Gaian Bottleneck
**They didn't survive.**

The Gaian Bottleneck hypothesis, by Astrobiologist Dr. Aditya Chopra, suggest that aliens beings are all dead. They simply didn't make it. Life forms on "habitable" planets failed to emerge enough to stabilize the planet and pave the way for more life.

## The Great Filter
**We're doomed, such as everyone else.**

Earth was subjected to five mass extinction events, nervertheless it evolved complex creatures. What if all "habitable" planets were hit with kiler asteroids, scorched by solar flares, torn apart by geological upheavals, seared by supernova blasts or gamma ray bursts ? Worst part is, we maybe havent encounter our own greatest filter.

## The Great Silence
**Alas, we're not worth it.**

The Great Silence hypothesis states that advanced begins who belong to a type III civilization on the Kardashev Scale, able to harness the energy output of a whole galaxy, simply do not reach out to insignificant carbon-based humans. Why bother whith Type 0 bipeds ?

## Early Birds
**Earth had an headstrat.**

In a study, Dr. Peter Behrrozi said that compared to all the planets that will ever form in th Universe, the Earth is actually quite early. The last star will burn out 100 trillion years from now and 92% of the planets are yet to be born? We are the first, but not necessarily the last.

## Not Life as we know it
**We've had it wrong the all time.**

Extarterrestrials may indeed not be biological beings like us at all. Noted astronomer Lord Martin Rees said they light be machines, not organic creatures for example. Se we should be looking for solar-harvesting structures as it will give us more chances to find something rather than focusing on carbon-based structues.

## A long road ahead of us
**We have a lot more shearching to do.**

SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) has barely scratched the surface of the radio universe. There are many more wave lengths to scan and we shouldn't give up hope yet.

## The Universe is really big
**We're simply too far away.**

46.5 billion light-years is the distnace to the edge of the observale universe. We've been able to scan for Extraterrestrials' signals to just around 40,000 light-years from Earth. We haven't outpassed the bounds of our galaxy, which is 100,000 light-years wide. Alien intelligences could simply be too far away four current technology to reach, and maybe it forever will.
